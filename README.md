Random Python Programs
======================
Created this to testing some web scraping scripts. Currently working on indexing information from manga websites.

-Right now, the Nyaa program just downloads the torrents. It doesn't check for files that have already been done. Trying to think of an efficient way to handle that.
-The MangaEden program loads data into the database, but it doesn't finish because of just how many series there are.
-The Batoto program is just a shell. It will be largely based on the MangaEden program with web scraping elements from the Nyaa program.
-"psql" file is a script with the create query for the database tables in PostgreSQL.
